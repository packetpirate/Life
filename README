Description:
------------

The game of life isn't necessarily a game, so much as it is a simulator. It simulates cell automata by enforcing certain rules on a grid of 'cells.' The rules are as follows:

- A cell will die of loneliness if it is surrounded by 0 or 1 other cells.
- A cell will die of overcrowding if it is surrounded by 4 or more other cells.
- A cell survives if it surrounded by 2 or 3 other cells.
- A new cell is created if an empty space is surrounded by exactly 3 other cells.

Some complex patterns can be created.

Instructions:
-------------

To 'play' the Game of Life, simply click a square to place a cell there. Once you are satisfied with the placement of your cells, click the 'Next' button. This will advance the cells a generation and enforce the rules on them. There is no objective in the Game of Life, though you could try to create a pattern that lasts the most generations. You can watch the game advance generations automatically by clicking the 'Start' button, and stop the simulation by pressing the 'Stop' button.
